## DETR (DEtection TRansformers)

DETR is a Transformer for Objects Detection in Image. Its Primary work is to predict the objects in the image and their position in the image. Based on the Position and size of the object we can draw  a bounding box. It takes an image as input and gives predictions for 100 objects inthe image. Each prediction has 92 classes (including No object class) and their probabilities associated with it.
